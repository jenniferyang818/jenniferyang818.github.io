            <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jennifer Yang, a recent UC Berkeley grad (go bears!) and incoming Software Engineer at Amazon in May. I was formerly an intern at Amazon in AWS Cryptography 
              and Liberty Mutual in the Products and Underwriting department. In my free time, I enjoy perusing interior design YouTube channels, falling off walls at the 
              bouldering gym, and trying new restaurants. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferyang8/"> Find me on LinkedIn</a> or reach out at: <a href="mailto:jyang8@berkeley.edu">jyang8@berkeley.edu</a>!
